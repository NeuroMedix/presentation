### Slide 1: Introduction to Dr. Sarah Bennett
- Meet Dr. Sarah Bennett: A research scientist at a small pharmaceutical startup.
- Focus: Alzheimer’s treatments.
- Each day brings immense pressure: Every passing moment means more patients waiting for a breakthrough.

---

### Slide 2: The Urgency of Alzheimer’s
- Alzheimer’s is relentless, stripping memories, identities, and loved ones away.
- Every 3 seconds: Someone in the world develops dementia.
- Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia.
- In Canada: 750,000 people live with this disease, making it the 7th leading cause of death.

---

### Slide 3: The Drug Development Struggle
- Sarah’s journey mirrors that of many scientists: slow and costly.
- Developing a new drug: Often a decade-long process.
- Success rates are dismal: Only 1 in 5,000 compounds make it to market.
- Global costs: Exceed $1.5 billion per approved drug.

---

### Slide 4: Enter NeuroMedix
- NeuroMedix: A game-changing platform designed to empower scientists like Sarah.
- Our mission: Revolutionize drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases.
- First focus: Alzheimer’s.
- Core technology: NP-VAE model trained on 30,000 DrugBank compounds and unique, biologically-active datasets.

---

### Slide 5: How NeuroMedix Works
- Traditional models struggle; ours excels with complex compounds.
- Our NP-VAE model: Compresses molecules into latent vectors with rich structural and functional details.
- Example for Sarah: 
  - She inputs an FDA-approved Alzheimer’s drug.
  - NeuroMedix generates three new drug candidates.
- Metrics provided: SA Score (ease of synthesis) and QED (drug-likeness).

---

### Slide 6: Model Accuracy and Metrics
- Structural similarity measured using Tanimoto scores.
- Achieved 94.44% accuracy in preserving 3D structural integrity.
- NeuroMedix gives Sarah confidence, speeding up the drug discovery process.

---

### Slide 7: Pushing Boundaries with Innovation
- NeuroMedix: Not a mere copy of existing models.
- We refined and adapted the model specifically for Alzheimer’s drug discovery.
- Encodes molecules from SMILES into nuanced chemical fingerprints.
- A crystal ball for drug discovery, reducing costly trial and error.

---

### Slide 8: Challenges and Limitations
- Limited resources during the hackathon: Trained on structural data only.
- Full drug viability requires additional features like logP, SA score, and QED.
- Future potential: Expand to a feature-rich model with more computational power.

---

### Slide 9: Remarkable Achievements
- Despite constraints: NeuroMedix accelerates Alzheimer’s drug discovery.
- Efficiency and cost-effectiveness demonstrated.
- Built to scale: Adaptable for other neurodegenerative diseases or therapeutic areas.

---

### Slide 10: The Future with NeuroMedix
- Sarah is no longer racing against time but leading a revolution.
- NeuroMedix transforms drug discovery: A leap forward, not a slow crawl.
- Vision: Transform medicinal chemistry and fuel life-saving therapies for the next generation.
